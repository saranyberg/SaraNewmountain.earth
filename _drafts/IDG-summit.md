I want to share the Inner Development Goals with the world!
Since 2015 we have the Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs, and also known as Agenda 2030 [LINK]. They are goals for humanity to achieve a sustainable development ... in 2030. (ev mer, se hemsida) Now, in 2022, we are already half-way towards the target year, but we haven't progressed half-way towards the targets. There are many reasons for this, but one is that we humans are not developed (?) enough to be able to cope with the systemic and complex challenges we are facing. Therefore, one solution (out of many solutions) which can help us towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals can be to develop our inner capacities - we need more inner development. But which are those inner capacities? To answer this question, some people have, together with researchers and scientists/ psychologists (?), looked into research and made surveys, and finally released the Inner Development Goals (IDGs) [LINK]!

Since I'm myself very passionate about working towards reaching the SDG13 - Climate (change?), and the other SDGs, I was directly interested (?/ wow/ "på") when I heard about that the IDGs would be released at a summit in Stockholm, my home town. So, I signed up directly and participated in it on the 29 April earlier this year. I learned so much and want to share the goals and skills with more people, so I thought it would be perfect to write a blog post about it!
