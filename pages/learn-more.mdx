# Learn more about climate change

If you don’t know so much about the causes and effects of climate change it can be hard to talk about it with others.
And if you don’t know about the urgency of the climate crisis you’re likely less motivated to take immediate action.
Therefore I have put together this list of some resources, from which you can learn more about climate change and other environmental issues,
and about the solutions.

### Climate science facts and basics

-   [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
    is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.
    They gather extensive research on climate science, its effects and about climate mitigation (reducing emissions to,
    and increasing the uptake of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere) and adaptation. The full reports are very extensive,
    but they have good summaries for policymakers which are shorter and easier to read. Thelatest one is the [Summary for
    policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM) about the
    Physical Science Basis from the Sixth Assessment Report.

-   [DN klimatet just nu](https://www.dn.se/klimatet-just-nu/): One of
    the largest Swedish newspapers has gathered facts of where we are right
    now concerning climate change, and where we are heading.

-   [Klimatklockan](https://stage.klimatklockan.se/): shows how much
    time we have until the remaining Swedish carbon budget has run out, if
    we continue to emit at the current pace.

### How and in which speed to reduce the emissions

-   [Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org) – a leading
    resource for information and insight about climate solutions
-   The [Exponential Roadmap
    Initiative](https://exponentialroadmap.org) is for innovators,
    transformers and disruptors taking action in line with 1.5°C, with
    the mission to halve emissions before 2030 through exponential
-   [Climate Interactive](https://www.climateinteractive.org/)
    creates accessible, scientifically rigorous tools that help people
    see connections, play out scenarios, and see what works to address
    the biggest challenges we face. They have developed the [En-ROADs
    simulator](https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/en-roads/), a
    policy simulation model that gives everyone the chance to design
    their own scenarios to limit future global warming.

-   [Climate Watch](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/) - offers open
    data, visualizations and analysis to help policymakers, researchers
    and other stakeholders gather insights on countries' climate
    progress
-   [Klimatsekretariatet](https://www.klimatsekretariatet.se/) has
    developed the ClimateVisualizer, a tool which helps municipalities
    in Sweden to see the roadmap to reduce emissions in line with the
    Paris Agreement.

### It’s not only about climate...

-   The [Planetary
    boundaries](https://stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html)
    concept presents a set of nine planetary boundaries within which
    humanity can continue to develop and thrive for generations to come.
    Crossing these boundaries increases the risk of generating
    large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.
-   [Doughnut Economics Action Lab](https://doughnuteconomics.org/) is
    working with 100’s of companies, cities and individuals to support a
    holistic world economy, by putting the concepts of Doughnut
    Economics into transformative action. In short, Doughnut Economics
    is about how we should keep within the planetary boundaries (under
    the ecological ceiling), and fulfil people’s essential needs (above
    a certain level of social foundation).
-   [The Global Goals for Sustainable
    Development](https://www.globalgoals.org/), also known as Agenda
    2030, because it’s important not only to focus on climate – we have
    16 other sustainability goals as well.

## Books

-   **“Exponentiell Klimatomställning”** by Rebecka
    Carlsson. It’s a great book about exponential climate
    technologies and behavioural changes; about climate
    solutions and with a sustainable business canvas – a
    tool and mental framework for developing successful,
    sustainable and scalable business models. Order one or
    several books on [Rebecka’s
    website](https://www.rebeckacarlsson.se/).
-   **“Changing the world we create”** by Mark Drewell and
    Björn Larsson. It’s introducing the concept of meta
    crisis: We’re not only facing a climate crisis, but also
    biodiversity, health and other crises. More interesting
    are the parts about the need for new perspectives, which
    those are and how we can shift to those. The
    perspectives are the views of ourselves, of the world,
    of our mind, of society and of our lives. Buy the
    physical book on e.g.
    [Adlibris](https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/changing-the-world-we-create-9781912892921),
    or as ebook on
    [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54324495-changing-the-world-we-create).
-   **“Doughnut economics - seven ways to think like a
    21st-century economist”** by [Kate
    Raworth](https://www.kateraworth.com/) (links to where
    to buy the book), see information in short on the
    [Doughnut Economics Action Lab
    website](https://doughnuteconomics.org/tools-and-stories/2).

## Workshops and courses

-   I participated in the [Climate
    Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/) workshop in early
    2021 and participated in a training to become a
    facilitator in mid-2021 to be able to facilitate such
    workshops. The workshop consists of three parts: First,
    you and other participants together put 42 cards in the
    correct order to show the causes and effects of climate
    change. This is followed by a part where you tune into
    your feelings, and finally you explore what actions you
    can take to have a positive impact on the climate.

## Video clips

-   [Climate Action Tracker: The state of the climate
    crisis in 2021 | TED](https://youtu.be/-wJo5aKBwq0) -
    is showing the current state of countries’ pledges to
    reduce emissions and what level of global heating these
    pledges will lead to.
-   Not so much facts, but rather for inspiration, I really
    like the positive future visions from Solarpunk! I can
    recommend [this 10-minute introduction
    to Solarpunk](https://youtu.be/u3aauiR9M88). Feel free to explore other videos
    as well!
